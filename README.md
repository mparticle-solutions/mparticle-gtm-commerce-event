## Commerce Event Template
[mParticle Commerce Events](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/commerce-tracking/) can be tracked by leveraging this GTM template. The current iteration only supports a single product for product actions. Additionally, the product must be configured as part of the tag. Finally this tag will only work if the mParticle SDK is fully initialized before being triggered. 

### Steps to enable: 
1. Select the Tag Template from the [Google Community Template Gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/?page=1).
2. Configure the tag including all additional attributes and flags. 
3. Configure the tags trigger. 
4. Deploy the tag.
